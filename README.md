# Move Forward

How many times did you receive those emails saying "...will not move forward" from recruiters? Being in the job seeker myself, I faced many challenges during job search. Let's list a few of them:

- lack of preparation;
- absence of a clear career objective and plan;
- no centralized job application tracking system;
- no centralized career tracking system;
- etc.

The list can expand to several other challenges. **Move Forward**, as you have guessed is here to help you move forward in your job applications and career in general.

## Features

### Job application tracking system

The first way Move Forward tries to help is by providing a centralized job application system where you can keep track of all the jobs you've applied to or are interrested in. This way, you can keep all information about your applications (company, job description, qualifications, important dates, etc.) in a single place and always remember the important details when they'll call you for an interview. Yes, sometimes we forget the name of the company and even wonder who did apply to that job we've never heard about ðŸ˜…?

### Career goal and objectives tracking

Save a clear career goal and set minimal objectives you can frequently track and assess. This data will be used in the coming versions to assess how you qualify for a particular job and offer custom recommendations to help you level up.
